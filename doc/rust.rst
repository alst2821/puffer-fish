The rust programming language book
----------------------------------

`Chapter 1
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html>`_ is an
introduction to the basic tools, including cargo and the installation
of the tools.

`Chapter 2
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html>`_
starts a 'guessing game' program. This starts by using simple
input/output with the std::io package.

There is a few examples of 'cargo' when one starts using the rand::Rng
package, including the commands 'cargo doc', 'cargo build', 'cargo
update'.

The documentation example::
  
  cargo doc --open

`Chapter 4
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html>`_
talks about ownership, the very special rust concept:

 - Each value in rust has an owner
 - There can only be one owner at a time
 - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Other things discussed are cloning, the Copy trait of a type, the `drop`
method (that implements the Drop trait).

For function calls, passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does.

The section on references explains the method as a way to avoid
the (protocol) of getting ownership when entering a function and
returning ownership on function return.

Normal references are not mutable. Adding `mut` changes the reference
to mutable reference.  Mutable references have one big restriction: if
you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other
references to that value.

Rust prevents the problem of `data races` by refusing to compile code
with data races!

Rules of references:

 - you can have either one mutable reference (read/write) or any
   number of immutable references. (Swimmer, single write, multiple read).
 - references must be always valid - rust checks this with lifetimes [#f3]_ and ownership.

The chapter about fixing unsafe programs revealed to me a lack of
understanding and the use of several methods:

 - references
 - indirection
 - static storage
 - borrow checker
 - ownership
 - read/write/ownership
 - lifetime of referred data

Methods to extend the lifetime (for the example of a function returning a string reference):

 - Move ownership by returning a String ( -> String )
 - Return a string literal ( -> &'static str )
 - Defer borrow checking to runtime using reference counted pointer ( -> Rc<String> )
 - Have the caller provide a "slot" (signature includes "output: &mut String")

The topics are: returning a reference, enough permissions, aliasing
and mutating a data structure

Only now after reading `chapter 5 <https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch05-03-method-syntax.html>`_, 
I realise that there are these properties on a variable:

 * readable (yes/no)
 * writeable (yes/no)
 * ownership (yes, no)

The `mut` keyword is needed for the `writeable` property.

The readable property is available on the variable and its references,
unless the ownership is gone and the access would be undefined.

`Chapter 6
<https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html>`_
introduces the Option<T> enum. Its `documentation
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html>`_ is useful.
