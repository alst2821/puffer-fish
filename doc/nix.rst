 Nix
=====

`Nix`_ is a project (and a language) closely related to the NixOS
linux distribution.

It started as an academic research by Eelco Doljstra whose PhD Thesis
is still a reference for concepts and components of the system.

It's taking me a while to get my head around the system and I am also
interested in the related project Guix that is led by Ludovic Courtes
(Inria).

A great source of information and examples are the `nix pills`_ [#f1]_ that
explain the basics and guide through producing derivations and nix expressions to build software.
