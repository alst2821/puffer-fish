 Nix
=====

Nix is a project closely related to the NixOS linux distribution.

It started as an academic research by Eelco Doljstra whose PhD Thesis
is still a reference for concepts and components of the system.

It's taking me a while to get my head around the system and I am also
interested in the related project Guix that is led by Ludovic Courtes
(Inria).
