 Welcome to Puffer Fish documentation!
=======================================

This is a documentation static site generated using `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

It is generated thanks to the generous service of `read the docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
and hosted by `github <https://github.com/yut45390/puffer-fish>`_.

The services are intended for software development and this website is
subverting them into publishing!
